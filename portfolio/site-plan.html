        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Who am I:</strong> As my idea is to make a brief portfolio, a brief account of my personal history, knowledge, impact and quality. I intend to put my name, city, state, a photo to recognize me and contact information such as phone number and social networks. Something important is to put my attention and also information that can reach the possible client or recruiter who can do a development training, show interest.

      </ul>
      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>
       <strong>What I do:</strong>  Here is the opportunity I have to describe the technologies that I have the most domain and expose the type of service that I am willing to perform. The importance of this part is that if someone is interested between my resume and that of another candidate, the exhibition of what I do, must be what will end the doubts and the client will close with me because he will know what I know how to do and if he fights with his requirements as a client or recruiter. The person who visits my site needs to easily know that I am a Front-End Developer and for those who are not used to the more technical terms, I can put Website Developer. The clearer and more honest about my abilities, the more confidence I will gain.

      </ul>
      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>What I've done: </strong>A list of past projects that got me here. Images and links to visit an application of mine will be made available and then the user will know what I can do. This is like a showcase, where I display my best projects in order to capture users' attention. The goal is to show that with my experience, the user can trust me and hire me
